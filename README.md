# NFL Algorithm - Professional Value Betting System

> *Advanced NFL player performance prediction and value betting engine*

**Version**: 2.1 | **Status**: Production Ready | **Target MAE**: ≤ 3.0

---

## System Overview

A comprehensive NFL betting algorithm combining:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ML Models** | Position-specific predictive models with defense adjustments |
| **Data Pipeline** | Live odds, weather, injuries, and player stats via nflreadpy |
| **Value Engine** | Kelly Criterion optimization with CLV tracking |
| **Validation** | Cross-season backtesting and performance metrics |
| **Automation** | Scheduled data updates and model retraining |

**Core Philosophy**: Achieve consistent profitability through disciplined, data-driven betting with rigorous risk management.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mattleonard16/nflalgorithm.git
cd nflalgorithm

# Install dependencies (auto-detects UV or venv)
make install

# Ingest real NFL data (2024 + 2025 seasons)
make ingest-nfl

# Option 1: Launch Streamlit dashboard (legacy)
make dashboard

# Option 2: Launch React dashboard (recommended)
make api              # Start FastAPI backend on :8000
make frontend-dev     # Start Next.js frontend on :3000
```

### Weekly Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate projections for the week
make week-predict SEASON=2025 WEEK=13

# 2. Materialize value bets for dashboard
make week-materialize SEASON=2025 WEEK=13

# 3. Launch Streamlit dashboard
make dashboard

# 4. View at http://localhost:8501
```

## React Dashboard

![NFL Algorithm Dashboard](docs/dashboard-screenshot.png)

The project now includes a modern React/Next.js dashboard alongside the original Streamlit version.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI serving the same SQLite database
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### Running the React Dashboard

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the API
make api

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Data Sources

| Source | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **nflreadpy** | Player stats, schedules, rosters | Nightly |
| **The Odds API** | Prop lines from multiple books | Real-time |
| **nflverse** | Snap counts, depth charts, routes | 4x daily |

### Key Features

- **Defense Adjustments**: Predictions adjusted based on how players perform vs their own average against specific defenses
- **Multi-Source Matching**: 3-tier player matching (ID → name+team → fuzzy)
- **Best Line Detection**: Auto-selects best sportsbook line per player/market
- **SQLite/MySQL**: Flexible backend for dev or production

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Rushing MAE | **3.6** | ≤ 3.0 | Optimizing |
| Receiving MAE | **4.1** | ≤ 3.5 | Optimizing |
| Value Bet ROI | **15.2%** | > 12% | Achieved |
| CLV Performance | **+2.3%** | > 0% | Achieved |
| Player Match Rate | **28%** | > 25% | Achieved |

## Dashboard Features

Access at `http://localhost:8501`:

| Tab | Features |
|-----|----------|
| **Live Bets** | Current value opportunities, best lines, recommendations |
| **Performance** | Model accuracy, ROI tracking, edge distribution |
| **CLV Analysis** | Closing line value tracking |
| **System** | Pipeline health, data freshness |

### Dashboard Controls
